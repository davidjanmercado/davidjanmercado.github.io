									is a French booking platform for land travel across Europe. It has a very clean and straightforward interface that I truly like. The simplicity makes it easy to book tickets without all the unnecessary details that most reservation systems have. It’s a good call that online advertising isn’t part of the business model because it can cause information overload if done incorrectly. Having traveled around Asia, Europe, North America, and the Middle East, I’ve seen quite a lot of reservation websites, each of which has its own good and bad points. What troubles me quite often is the immense information that most websites try to squeeze in on one page. It’s ridiculous, to say the least. In contrast, Captain Train does a good job in maintaining the interaction flow to the bare minimum. The updates on transportation strikes (which happen quite often in France!) also add a unique and personal touch to the interface.</p>
								<p>On the contrary, I dislike the inconsistent layout between the website and the mobile app. As you can see in Figures 1 and 2, the layout doesn’t translate well from the web to the mobile version. In Figure 2, the information is somehow legible yet there's no clear hierarchy. The time details are also redundant in the web version as it appears both in the main ticket and the dropdown section (Figure 1). </p>

								<p>I redesigned the Cart section to improve its legibility (Figures 3 and 4). Important details such as the location, train, seat number, and refund options have been emphasized. The use of orange makes the time and price stand out. If anything, those two are possibly the most important considerations when booking a ticket. The structure also makes it easy to know when the trip is, what time the train leaves and arrives, and how much it costs. I’ve also added an icon between the departure and arrival stations in the form of two arrows on a rail line that clearly reflects the goal of the product and ties quite well with the company logo. These changes provide a consistent look and clear visual hierarchy that embody a well-thought-out design.</p>

								<p>What’s missing in Captain Train though is the ability to compare cheap prices across different days. This new feature would take into account travelers who are pretty flexible with their schedule and would much prefer a cheaper ticket even at an ungodly hour. What I propose is a Single-Day View (current implementation) and Three-Day View (Figure 5) to show the cheapest prices and its respective departure and arrival times. The schedule is divided into three sections (morning, afternoon, and evening). The cheapest price within each section is shown in a 3x3 grid; and the cheapest among the nine is in orange. The details are shown when an item is selected. The layout resembles the redesign of the cart section to provide a consistent look all throughout the website.</p>

								<p>The phrasing of some content can also be improved to capture a more energetic vibe. For example, “What do our customers say?” can be rephrased to “Our customers are happy!” to have a positive rather than a passive and formal voice to it.</p>
								<p>There are definitely rooms for improvement but at the fundamental level, Captain Train has already gotten its interaction flow right. Keeping a human-centered approach to design is how it’s supposed to be.</p>
